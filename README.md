## Files in the `script` folder

Files that are sourced from the dnscrypt repository's own `contrib` folder are denoted with an asterisk(*),
and have a separate license than the rest of this repository. See `contrib\COPYING.dnscrypt`.

File name | Description
--------- | -----------
`blacklist.conf`* | List of various hosts files from around the web, and the ones in this repository
`whitelist.conf` | List of various hosts files to **exclude** from the blacklist
`make_blacklist.py`* | Modified version of the `generate-domains-blacklist.py` script from dnscrypt

### How to use `make_blacklist.py`

```bat
$ py -2 .\make_blacklist.py
```

The final blacklist result is written to `blacklist.txt`, and the exclusions are written to `whitelist.tmp` (only needed for debugging).
